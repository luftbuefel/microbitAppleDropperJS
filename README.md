# microbitAppleDropperJS
I remade my apple dropper game using Javascript blocks.

Press A to move left, press B to  move right. Catch the falling apples and see how high of a score you can get!

You can see the code in appleDropper.js

If  you jjust want to play, download the hex file and load it onto your Microbit.
